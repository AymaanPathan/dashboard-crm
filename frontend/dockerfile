# A Dockerfile is like a recipe or blueprint that tells Docker how to build a mini isolated computer (container) with everything your app needs — Node.js, dependencies, and environment setup.


## we need a base image with Node.js [we have webapp so we can use node image]
FROM node


# Create a working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# COPY entire current [project] to /app
COPY . /app

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["npm", "run","dev"]
